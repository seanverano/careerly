## <a name="one"></a>‚ùì The Problem

Preparing for a job search is overall time-consuming, and traditional methods often overwhelm job seekers, leaving them unsure where to focus. 

A streamlined solution is needed to help job seekers spend more time focusing on improving their skills rather than spending it on tasks such as creating a resume or searching for job listings.
